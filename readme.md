A Discord.py Character.AI Selfbot with useful commands

## How to add a profile?
Create a configuration file named ‘/data/botname.yml’ in the project's root directory:

```yaml
token: YOUR DISCORD TOKEN
character_id: YOUR C.AI BOT'S ID
```

Also, don't forget to define your C.AI User token with ```export CAI_TOKEN="your_characterai_token_here"```!
This way, you'll be connected to the account that will have access to the bot.
